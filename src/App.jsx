here is the proper description -->  application name must be : Task Management GS , The landing page is Login Page 
where we are implementing jwt thing fake authentication  private route thing , after that Landing page looks like 
top having navbar with logout ( that will redirect to login page and jwt fake token will delete from local storage thing...) , light and dark mode toggle botton , and a temp fake user profile ( when click or hover a card of that opened and fake details )
below that there is left side filter option middle searchbar to seach tasks , right side Bookmared tasked( that open a page with tasks that are book marked ). After that at  Middle it at first only 5 task should be visible from store  , below more tasks loading thing you have to do
These tasks are clickable and when i click on certain task , that task dynamic routing page will open and that is out edit page also
like there are fields which are editable after changes below update button will enable and we can made changes to it or side there is delete button , that is for the edit page
in the main landing page below tasks are showing i want a add new task button that will redirect or navigate to page addnewtasks , in that task fields are Titles and subtitles , other things i have to store so that i can sort or filter it later are : date and time , priority(low/mid/high)
and in landing page there is a see all tasks button too , that opens a page that will  show all tasks that we added , and each task is accessiable like if we click weredirect to that task edit page , also delete button also there 


here is complete thing that i wanted so firstly we have to discuss the things how gonna do , like :

Planned overall project flow and structure.
Created outline of how different components and features will connect.
